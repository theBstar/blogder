## Blogder - A visual blog builder
Makes blogs as easy as note-taking. 


Blogder (blog + builder) is a prototype for the same. It is a visual tool to take notes. You would use Editorjs - a rich text editor to write these notes (banner image), It stores these notes/blogs (whatever you call them) in your local file system as JSONs. Converts them to HTML pages at build time and you can host them on Github pages. I am using Nextjs APIs to make these possible. It is not close to a full-featured blog engine.
